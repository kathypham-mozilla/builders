					<p>The internet's amazing, weird, sometimes a little icky. Let’s face it: it could use some fixing. Are you a student, coder, designer, creator who wants to help us build new services and platforms that foster collaboration during this crisis, or put privacy first, or combat filter bubbles and polarization, or AI platforms that work for the end user, the citizen? Mozilla’s Fix-The-Internet MVP Lab is an 8 week-long incubator-style program this Spring to mobilize & fund around products and technologies that enable everyone to connect and build a better society.</p>
					<p>Want to learn more about our Fix-The-Internet Topics?  Register to join our <a href="https://mozilla.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZ0odOCqrTkv1aW13JeCZdNdI96m2z5OgA">Live Q+A on Thursday, March 26th at 8pm ET.</a></p>
					<p><strong>Come build with us</strong>: <strong class="upper"><a href="https://mozilla2.forms.fm/fix-the-internet-spring-lab/forms/7758">Apply now</a></strong> for our Spring MVP Lab if you want to build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of your idea this Spring. We are looking for products in the following areas:</p>
					<ol>
						<li class="highlight"><strong>Collaboration &amp; Society</strong>, particularly in view of the current global crisis: (i) Foster better collaboration online, (ii) Grassroots collaboration around issues &amp; emergencies, (iii) Local &amp; neighborhood support networks, (iv) Supporting small businesses, (v) Social money-pooling for issues, people & businesses.</li>
						<li><strong>Decentralized Web:</strong> build a new, decentralized architecture for the internet from infrastructure, communications, media &amp; money using the blockchain and peer-to-peer technologies.</li>
						<li><strong>Messaging &amp; Social networking:</strong> can we build a new way to communicate online that favors privacy, people, and users' interests? What needs to evolve?</li>
						<li><strong>Misinformation &amp; Content:</strong> ideas for services that help us get beyond polarization, filter bubbles and fake news.</li>
						<li><strong>Surveillance Capitalism:</strong> whether it’s big tech or governments, everyone’s collecting your data. How do we put the user back in control of their data?</li>
						<li><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> that work to benefit communities and citizens.</li>
					</ol>

				<h2>FAQ</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Tell me more about the themes this program is focused on?</strong></p>
						<div class="answer">
							<ul>
								<li>To learn more about Mozilla’s focus areas, check out Mozilla’s 2019 Internet Health Report at <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2019/04/23/its-complicated-mozillas-2019-internet-health-report/" title="It's complicated: Mozialla's 2019 internet health report">https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2019/04/23/its-complicated-mozillas-2019-internet-health-report/</a></li>
								<li>Here’s one fun read to get some ideas for products and technologies that are taking off in China: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/13/magazine/internet-china-wechat.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share" title="China's internet is flowering">https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/13/magazine/internet-china-wechat.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share</a></li>

						</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Can a person apply individually or are you only looking for teams?</strong></p>
						<div class="answer">
							<ul>
								<li>In rare cases, one person can build a product all by themselves. Since you’ll be building software, such a person would, by definition, be a strong coder who also has strong design and product sense</li>
								<li>In the vast majority of cases, it takes a team of 2- to 4- people to build shippable software, including engineering, design, and other key skills</li>
								<li>You can apply by yourself, but to ship your vision, you’ll need to find other people to join you. So once you’ve applied, please start looking for team-mates right away. You can update your application to indicate that you’ve found partners</li>
								<li>We have created a Slack channel where you can post your project and look for team mates. You can also pivot or abandon your project as you connect with team mates</li>
								<li>Not all applicants to this program will be accepted. Applicants who apply with a team, or who find a team before we review their application, will have a better chance of being accepted into this program</li>
								<li>We do expect to accept a number of solo applicants into the program, and for those folks, their first order of business will be to build a team in the first 2 weeks of the program</li>
								<li>Two weeks into the program, applicants who have not been able to build or join a team and cannot build their software all by themselves will not be able to stay in the program</li>
